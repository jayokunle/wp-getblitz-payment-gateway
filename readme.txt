Accept SEPA Instant Transfers across Europe with the GetBlitz Payment Gateway. Secure, fast, and open-source.

== Description ==

GetBlitz is an open-source SEPA Instant Transfer gateway that runs on your infrastructure — zero middlemen, zero tracking, zero lock-in. Built for European businesses that value sovereignty.

With this WooCommerce plugin, you can accept real-time EUR bank transfers across all 36 SEPA countries. Funds settle in under 10 seconds, directly to your bank account.

Key Features:
* **SEPA Instant Transfers**: Funds settle in seconds.
* **Direct Settlement**: Funds flow directly to your bank account (Qonto, Revolut Business, etc.).
* **Zero Transaction Fees**: Pay a flat monthly fee to GetBlitz, not a percentage of your sales.
* **Data Sovereignty**: Your customer data stays on your infrastructure.
* **Real-time Notifications**: Instant order updates via WebSockets.
* **Plugin Source Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/jayokunle/wp-getblitz-payment-gateway)

3. Navigate to WooCommerce > Settings > Payments > GetBlitz SEPA Instant.

* **API Key**: The API key allows the plugin to communicate securely with GetBlitz.
  * Go to `Getblitz -> Settings -> API Keys -> Generate New Key`
  * Copy this key into the plugin settings.

== External services ==

This plugin connects to GetBlitz services to initialize and process SEPA instant payments during checkout.

1. GetBlitz REST API (`https://app.getblitz.io`)
- Purpose: create payment sessions and verify final payment status for WooCommerce orders.
- Data sent: order amount (in cents), currency, merchant reference ID (derived from WooCommerce order ID), API authentication token from your plugin settings, and session ID for status lookups.
- When sent: when a customer starts payment and when the plugin verifies payment status after customer confirmation.

2. GetBlitz webhook callback (from GetBlitz to your WordPress site)
- Purpose: receive asynchronous payment events (`payment.success`, `payment.partial`, `payment.failed`, `payment.expired`) and update order status.
- Data received and processed: merchant reference ID, event type, reference/session identifiers, and paid amount where applicable.
- When received: after payment lifecycle events occur on GetBlitz.

3. GetBlitz real-time WebSocket endpoint (`wss://app.getblitz.io` by default, configurable)
- Purpose: provide real-time checkout payment state updates in the customer payment widget.
- Data used: session ID/client token tied to the checkout payment session.
- When used: while the customer is on the hosted payment widget flow.
